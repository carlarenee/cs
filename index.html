  <h2>About</h2>
  <div class="about flex-mobile-column">
    <div>
      <p>I&#39;m a multidisciplinary web leader with nearly 20 years of creative and technical experience across design, 
        development, and product delivery. I studied Digital Media (film, photography, computing arts) at UC San 
        Diego and co‑founded a yoga studio where I led marketing and digital strategy; the business will mark its 
        20th year in 2026. In 2016 I moved to New York, completed a full‑stack JavaScript immersion, and built React 
        projects before joining a major publishing company. From 2017–2025 I worked as a senior developer, tech lead, 
        and web development manager, creating custom features and selecting appropriate off‑the‑shelf solutions. </p>
      <p>I currently consult on digital strategy, am building an organizational/goal‑setting app and trying to grow 
        a food forest in my backyard. When I&#39;m not working you&#39;ll find me in the garden, on the slopes or at the beach.

        as offer users the opportunity to create an archive of past achievements. More to come, it's still in the baby
        stages of development. The dream is to build the mobile app then fit it to work as a browser extension as well as 
        connect to a print-on-demand service.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned.... I aim to have a working prototype for testing by mid March, 2026.</p>
