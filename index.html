  <h2>About</h2>

    <div>
      <p>I&#39;m a multidisciplinary web leader with nearly 20 years of creative and technical experience across design, 
        development, and product delivery. I studied Digital Media (film, photography, computing arts) at UC San 
        Diego and co‑founded a yoga studio where I led marketing and digital strategy; the business will mark its 
        20th year in 2026. In 2016 I moved to New York, completed a full‑stack JavaScript immersion, and built React 
        projects before joining a major publishing company. From 2017–2025 I worked as a senior developer, tech lead, 
        and web development manager, creating custom features and selecting appropriate off‑the‑shelf solutions. </p>
      <p>I currently consult on digital strategy, am building an organizational/goal‑setting app and trying to grow 
        a food forest in my backyard. When I&#39;m not working you&#39;ll find me in the garden, on the slopes or at the beach. 
        Check out my past work and CV, and reach out if you&#39;d like to collaborate or share gardening tips!</p>

      <h3>TESSERAE Mobile App and Browser Extension</h3>
      <p>Stack: React Native and TBD</p>
      <p>This was an idea I had around the New Year. The app seeks to serve as a motivational, goal setting app as well
        as offer users the opportunity to create an archive of past achievements. More to come, it's still in the baby
        stages of development. The dream is to build the mobile app then fit it to work as a browser extension as well as 
        connect to a print-on-demand service.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned.... I aim to have a working prototype for testing by mid March, 2026.</p>

          <h3>Hachette Book Group Site</h3>
          <p>I joined HBG as a WordPress developer shortly before launching their WordPress VIP platform site. I helped migrate dozens of standalone sites into the platform, then served as senior developer, tech lead, and web development manager — overseeing custom feature development, site launches, user management, and product roadmaps.

          <h3>James Patterson Author Site</h3>
          <p>I worked as the Senior Developer for this migration and redesign project, setting up the WordPress child theme file 
            structure, DNS configuration to leverage domain based theme loading. This site called for several custom plugins to make product data 
            available to the WP dashboard for editors. I worked closely with a designer/FE dev to build these 
            plugins and blocks; setting up data feeds while they styled them. I owned code review, 
            testing, code deployment and final DNS switch. My role included ongoing site maintenance and updates</p>

          <h3>Road Trip USA Website</h3>
          <p>Stack: Stand alone WordPress website.</p>
          <p>My role: Site maintenance; plugin updates, user maintenance, content updates. One challenge with rtusa
            was the request to utilize bespoke corporate Wordpress tools on a stand alone site. The solution involved
            retrofitting some of the custom built plugins, for example, a newsletter sign up tool integrated with a corporate CRM
            account, to work with a separate WP build and separate newsletter tool.</p>
